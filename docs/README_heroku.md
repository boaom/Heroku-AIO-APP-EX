## Heroku will stop offering free product plans and shut down free dynos starting Nov. 28, 2022.

## Attention

 1. **Do not abuse service from Heroku or your account could get banned. Deploy at your own risk.**
 2. Aria2 & qBittorrent download speed is limited to 5MB/s on default.
 3. The Heroku filesystem is ephemeral - that means that any changes to the filesystem whilst the dyno is running only last until that dyno is shut down or restarted. In addition, dynos will restart every day.
 4. To prevent Heroku dyno from auto-sleeping, use website monitoring service such as uptimerobot to http ping your heroku domain every 10 mins.

## <a id="more"></a>More usages and precautions

 1. To enable Telegram notification function, you need to talk to @BotFather in Telegram to register a bot. Add the bot to a channel you created, and get ChatID of the channel. Please Google for detailed steps.
 
    Edit the config/script.conf file. Fill in the corresponding options for botid:token and ChatID, then the notification function will take effect.
 2. Known pyLoad bugs：
    - Redirect to http after login，solution: close the pyLoad page and reopen it.
    - Fail to delete archives after extraction, solution: Settings--Plugins--ExtractArchive, set "Move to trash instead delete" to off.
 3. After adding following content to rclone.conf file, you can use local heroku storage as a Rclone remote for manually uploading via Rclone Web UI.

      ```
      [local]
      type = alias
      remote = /mnt/data
      ```

 4. For apps which don't support custom path for qBittorrent, uncomment followings line in Caddyfile under config/caddy folder before deployment:

            handle /api* {       
                    reverse_proxy * localhost:61804
            }

 5. Aria2 JSON-RPC path： \${GLOBAL_PORTAL_PATH}/jsonrpc   
    Aria2 XML-RPC path： \${GLOBAL_PORTAL_PATH}/rpc
 6. It is not possible to configure a Rclone remote which requires web authentication through Rclone web UI in this app.
